# Palmer Penguin Analysis
This project aims to deliver insights of palmer penguin demographics based on palmer penguin datasets. We analysed the datasets to find some insights regarding body features between 3 species in 3 different islands within 3 years and most importantly about how to tell the differences between those three species in three different islands and how to distinguish their sexes. 

Furthermore, our hypothesis which results from a manual analysis is also supported by a supervised learning technique called Logistic Regression. The probability of 4 features that can be used to distinguish between male and female palmer penguins are:
1. Bill Depth
2. Bill Length
3. Body Mass
4. Flipper Length
